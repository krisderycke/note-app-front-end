## What:
Use my own api made from the database exc to make a real note app where you can add, update, delete all the notes.

## Sprint 0:
Start by knowing what technology is out there. looking into React, Angular and Vue.js
Edit: after doing some research i decided to work with React. Angular is loosing its benchmark and Vue is still
a bit too young (not enough experience in the community). 
[REACT](https://reactjs.org/) is very good for making PWA (progressive web apps) which looks more interesting for me.
